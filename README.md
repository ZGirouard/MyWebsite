# MyWebsite
Teaching myself how to build a website.
Written using CSS and HTML.
Written with Sublime Text editor.

Update 12/28/2023: This project was more of a learning project for me than anything else. I've decided to scrap this project and am currently working on a new version of my website that I hope to publish. Since creating this webstie, I've taken a web-develpoment course that has taught me further principles. I hope to publish my official website soon.
